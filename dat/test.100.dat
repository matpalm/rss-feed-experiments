http://wwwautoblog.com/rss.xml|Thu, 13 Mar 2008 02:55:00 +1100|Motorsports , Audi , Peugeot Click above for high-res gallery from this week's 12 Hours of Sebring practice An epic battle is shaping up for this weekend's running of the 12 Hours of Sebring . Audi versus Peugeot. The R10 TDI versus the 908 HDi . Diesel versus diesel. This will be the first and perhaps only time that these two teams race on American soil, though the contest will be repeated many times in the European Le Mans Series this season. Since Monday, Audi and Peugeot have been battling for the best lap times during practice sessions in preparation for this weekend's endurance race at Sebring Raceway, and Peugeot got the upper hand on both Monday and Tuesday. Audi, which is fielding two cars to Peugeot's one, finally fought back today posting the fastest lap time of the week thanks to driver Dindo Capello, who ran a 1:45.491, just 0.017 seconds faster than Stephane Sarrazin in the Peugeot 908. But Audi and Peugeot in the LMP1 class should be wary of focusing too much on each other, as there are other entrants that could spoil their fun. Marco Andretti, for instance has been blisteringly fast in his Andretti Green Racing Acura ARX-01b, setting the second fastest lap time overall on Tuesday. As we learned from watching the LMP2 class beat up on Audi last year, Le Mans racing is anyone's game. The nature of endurance racing, however, favors fuel economy, and therefore the diesel-powered R10 TDI and 908 HDi should have the advantage. There will be plenty of great racing in the GT1 and GT2 classes as well, with Aston Martin squaring off against the Corvette Racing Team and Porsche taking on Ferrari, respectively. Stay tuned for race results probably late Saturday or early Sunday, and check out some spectacular images from this week's testing in the gallery below.

Of the 34 brands we track sales, 19 showed an improvement in their daily average sales rate last year. The majority of those that didn't, we're sad to say, are either domestic U.S. brands or brands that are owned by a domestic U.S. automaker. Big ups to Mazda, though, which won our coveted Biggest Winner of the Year honor by growing its daily average sales rate 9.8% and selling nearly 300,000 vehicles. We can't say we're surprised that Jaguar is our Biggest Loser of the Year after posting daily average sales rate that fell 24.4% last year. We'd also like to call out Jeep for posting a 3.0% improvement thanks to the hot-selling Wrangler Unlimited, as well as Lincoln, which, despite all odds, increased its daily average sales rate by 8.8% and sold an additional 11,000 vehicles last year. There are other plenty of other proud automakers in the list below we don't have room (or time) to mention. Of course, the biggest news in auto sales for 2007 is that Ford Motor Company was supplanted by Toyota Motor Company as the second largest automaker in the U.S. Toyota sold 2,620,825 units in 2007 compared to Ford's 2,572,599. We weren't all that impressed with ToMoCo's final tally of a 2.7% daily average sales rate increase, but that's all it needed after Ford posted a 12.7% decrease. General Motors, of course, is still well ahead of both with 3,866,620 units sold, while Chrysler could be breathing down Ford's neck with 2,076,650 sales if we expected that number would increase in 2008, which we don't. Note that there were 307 selling days last year compared to 306 selling days in 2006, so the figures below represent the change in daily average sales rate (average number of vehicles sold per day) and not the change in raw number of units sold. Biggest Winner of the Year Mazda 9.8% at 296,110 (2006: 268,786) Biggest Loser of the Year Jaguar -24.4% at 15,683 (2006: 20,683) BRANDS Acura -10.8% at 180,104 (2006: 201,223) Audi 3.4% at 93,506 (2006: 90,116) BMW 6.7% at 293,795 (2006: 274,432) Buick -23% at 185,791 (2006: 240,657) Cadillac -5.7% at 214,726 (2006: 227,014) Chevrolet -6.5% at 2,265,641 (2006: 2,415,428) Chrysler -10.5% at 543,011 (2006: 604,874) Dodge -2.1% at 1,058,402 (2006: 1,077,579) Ford -13.9% at 2,101,244 (2006: 2,433,086) GMC 4.8% at 505,746 (12/06: 481,222) Honda 4.5% at 1,371,438 (2006: 1,308,135) HUMMER -22% at 55,986 (2006: 71,524) Hyundai 2.2% at 467,009 (2006: 455,520) Infiniti 4.5% at 127,038 (2006: 121,146) Jaguar -24.4% at 15,683 (2006: 20,683) Jeep 3.0% at 475,237 (2006: 460,052) Kia 3.5% at 305,473 (2006: 294,302) Land Rover 3.4% at 49,550 (2006: 47,774) Lexus 1.8% at 329,177 (2006: 322,434) Lincoln 8.8% at 131,487 (2006: 120,476) Mazda 9.8% at 296,110 (2006: 268,786) Mercedes 1.8% at 253,433 (2006: 248,080) Mercury -7.2% at 168,422 (2006: 180,848) MINI 7.0% at 42,045 (2006: 39,171) Nissan 4.5% at 941,200 (2006: 898,103) Pontiac -13% at 358,022 (2006: 410,229) Porsche 1.0% at 34,693 (2006: 34,227) Saab -10.3% at 32,711 (2006: 36,349) Saturn 5.7% at 240,091 (2006: 226,375) Subaru -7.0% at 187,208 (2006: 200,703) Suzuki 0.6% at 101,884 (2006: 100,990) Toyota 2.9% at 2,291,648 (2006: 2,220,090) Volkswagen -2.3 at 230,572 (2006: 235,140) Volvo -8.6% at 106,213 (2006: 115,807) NA: Mitsubishi COMPANIES BMW Group 6.7% at 335,840 (2006: 313,603) Chrysler Group -3.4% at 2,076,650 (2006: 2,142,505) Ford Motor Co -12.1% at 2,572,599 (2006: 2,918,674) General Motors -6.5% at 3,866,620 (2006: 4,124,645) Honda America 2.5% at 1,551,542 (2006: 1,509,358) Nissan North America 4.5% at 1,068,238 (2006: 1,019,249) Toyota Motor Co. 2.7% at 2,620,825 (2006: 2,542,524) ?

From its extremely compact yet very powerful V-Twin engine to its extremely uncomfortable saddle, this is a bike that demands attention from its rider. Also extreme is its ability to wheelie and perform stoppies, so much so that it must be ridden with great respect on the street. The Supermoto category is basically made up of off-road bikes equipped with just the bare essentials to be street-legal. Off go the knobbies and in their places are spooned grippy sportbike tires on 17-inch wheels. This bike fits neatly into that category and was created with maximum fun in mind; but does the SXV's extreme nature take the joy out of riding it on the street? That's what we set to find out when we borrowed one for our garage. Read on to see how it fared.

http://wwwautoblog.com/rss.xml|Tue, 29 Apr 2008 03:02:00 +1000|SUVs , Trucks/Pickups , Plants/Manufacturing , UAW/Unions Word just came in from General Motors that the automaker will be reducing shifts at four different plants that produce its full-size trucks and SUVs in an effort to bring production "in line with market demand". The output slowdown will begin on July 14th at GM's Flint, Janesville and Pontiac assembly plants, which produce the Chevy Heavy-Duty Silverado, Tahoe, Suburban, Silverado and GMC Yukon, Yukon XL and Sierra. The Oshawa truck plant will also be affected starting Sept. 8th. All told, the shift reductions will nix 80,000 full-size pickups and 50,000 full-size SUVs from GM's North American production capacity. According to GM, both vehicles have lost ground in the market across the industry, with sales of full-size pickups dropping 15-percent and SUVs down 26-percent for the first quarter of 2008. This isn't surprising considering the cost of fuel right now and the subsequent reduced demand for larger vehicles. GM didn't provide specifics about how this would affect workers, only saying that it will "result in lower staffing requirements at all four plants," and that the details "would be worked out over the next several weeks with the UAW and CAW." Naturally, GM felt the need to brighten up the lackluster announcement by highlighting that car and CUV sales are up. However, it hasn't made a decision to boost output of either type of vehicle in lieu of said increased demand. Check out GM's full press release after the jump.

But that isn't about to stop Holland-based Zeta Europe BV, which owns Borrani wheels and has acquired the rights to the defunct Carrozzeria Touring. The coachbuilder was originally established in 1926 and popularized the advanced Superleggera construction method, consisting of small-diameter tubular frames draped with thin-gauge aluminum sheetmetal and employed on numerous Alfa Romeos, Maseratis, Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Aston Martins, among others. The name Superleggera was revived for the recently-terminated lightweight Lamborghini Gallardo, though strictly speaking the supercar did not use the classic construction method. Carrozzeria Touring is now gearing up for a revival with a new Superleggera, to debut in a week at the famous Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este, the classic motor show where a trophy honoring Touring's founder is awarded each year. Aside from the teaser silhouette image shown above, little is known about the new Superleggera, but we're looking forward to finding out. The coachbuilder is also anticipated to show the Ballagio Fastback, an estate wagon based on the Maserati Quattroporte (like the one on which we previously reported ), previewed by a teaser mixed in with the classic images on the company's new website .

The new model would be a low-cost vehicle targeted at markets in South America, Russia, India and China. Depending on how the Italian automaker determines a budget automobile would reflect on the company's other products, the vehicle could be marketed under the Fiat nameplate, or possibly under a different one altogether. If the company decides it will wear the Fiat badge, it could revive the Uno nameplate and effectively replace the Palio (pictured above), which currently serves as Fiat's "world car", with production in Brazil, India, Turkey, South Africa, North Korea and China, in hatchback, sedan, wagon and pickup body-styles. Fiat's close relations with Tata, makers of the Nano, could come into play, but one way or another, nobody does small cars like Fiat, so the competition had better take note. [Source: paultan.org ] ?

The government already has 355 Toyota and Honda hybrids in its fleet, but Aussie lawmakers would like to utilize its own home-grown workforce for future models. NSW Premier Morris Lemma wants the option to purchase hybrids from both both GM-owned Holden and Ford of Australia, and has even guaranteed that his government will be one of the first customers in line if Holden offered a battery-assisted Commodore within two years, as has been reported . Unfortunately, a promise from the government for a few hundred sales is hardly enough incentive on its own for an automaker to begin developing a hybrid, so both Holden and Ford will no doubt be investigating closely whether or not there's enough demand in the Australian market for a gas-electric hybrid to support the investment.

The funding will be centered around the newly established Toyota Research Institute of North America (TRI-NA), which is tasked with accelerating advanced research on energy and the environment, safety, and mobility infrastructure. TRI-NA will not build new facilities, however, though it will utilize existing space in Ann Arbor, Michigan, at the Toyota Technical Center. The Governor of the state, Jennifer M. Granholm, understandably welcomed the news. In addition to the millions of dollars pumped into Michigan's economy, TRI-NA hopes to be staffing upwards of 60 employees by 2010. For those who are counting, Toyota now directly employs over 43,000 in North America, and it purchases more than $30 billion in parts, materials goods and services from North American suppliers each year. While a still a drop in the bucket compared to what our own domestics spend in this country, it's not for nothing. [Source: Toyota] Continue reading Toyota sets up new research institute in U.S.A. ?

We've found that the key to the new nose is partnering it with lighter colors (silver, white, etc.) and avoiding the darker hues that don't do much to blend with the bright metallic mug. While we've already covered details of the TSX in our previous post , a few of the high points are worth repeating. The new 2.4-liter four is making 201 hp and a much-needed 176 lb.-ft. of torque, while still doing extremely well on the fed's sniffer test. The track has been widened and the wheelbase lengthened, but the emphasis on the TSX's sportiness was lost in the list of standard and optional equipment. The TSX gets standard Bluetooth, a USB port, iPod integration, a seven-speaker sound system, dual-zone climate control, HID headlamps and a moonroof. Option up for the Technology Package and you get an additional three speakers, a rear-view camera, plus voice-activated navigation with Acura Link, traffic rerouting and real-time weather. Aiming at the well-to-do youth market is Acura's plan for the TSX and execs hope to "dramatically increase" the 30,000 or so TSXs they've unloaded per year since the car's introduction. And in an effort to raise the high-class status of the entire Acura brand, the automaker has also partnered with the W hotel chain to have Acura vehicles as the preferred whip at the high-end urban enclaves. Hit the jump for Acura's full press release. Continue reading New York 2008: 2009 Acura TSX revealed... again... but LIVE ?

And because the obscenely wealthy have kids, too, there will always be more costly ways to spoil them. So if the pedal cars we brought you last month just won't do the trick, here's a throwback that is bound to. This reproduction 1927 Baby Bugatti Type 52 isn't actually a miniaturization of a full-size car. It's a retro recreation of the Baby Bugatti that Ettore actually offered to the scions of industry and princes of Europe in the late 1920s. Only 499 were said to have been made, and all were capable of running around the mansion grounds at around 10 mph. This recreation was modeled on one example of the original purchased at auction. It measures about six and a half feet long and is hand made of aluminum with genuine leather seats and bonnet straps. Although the product isn't licensed by Bugatti, it still costs a very Bugatti-like ?6350 (just shy of ten grand in American greenbacks), but is only available for delivery within France and doesn't include the electric motor and wiring. Your kid won't need a driver's license to use it, but he or she will need to learn to say "trust fund" first. [Source: Singulier via Luxurylaunches ] ? Read ?|?

And that puts a hurting on everything -- especially when you have to spend even more money getting your truck hauled out of the ice it just fell through. Not that any of this really stops them, because, well, there isn't much else to do in Iceland. So follow the link and check out the trucks in the slideshow. It's big-wheel badness.

Given that the email was the 500 newsletter, that can only mean one thing: the Fiat 500 Abarth is coming to Geneva.

Alex just bought a PS3, John already has one, and I'm trying to convince the Misses that after Blu-Ray won the war against HD-DVD we're due to replace our aging console with a new unit from Sony. Logitech just upped the ante with the release of its new Driving Force GT Wheel, but I highly doubt that it's going to help my case. Regardless, the new wheel carries over all the features we loved about the outgoing model, including 900-degrees of rotation, steering-wheel mounted paddle shifters and a separate stick to swap cogs when we're sliding sideways through turn 11 at Laguna. But Logitech hasn't stopped there. The new wheel was designed in collaboration with Gran Turismo's developers at Polyphony Digital, and features a new force-feedback system that supposedly recreates the feeling of understeer, oversteer and all-out traction loss, along with new controls on the wheel that allow you to adjust brake bias, traction control and damper settings on the fly. Plus, the horn lights up. The Logitech Driving Force GT Wheel will go on sale sometime in early May, carrying a price tag of around $150. Gran Turismo 5 Prologue will be released on April 17th on both Blu-Ray and through direct download, but for those of us that can't convince our significant others a new PS3 is worth the cash, the new wheel is compatible with both GT3 and GT4 on our existing PS2s.

http://wwwautoblog.com/rss.xml|Mon, 03 Mar 2008 17:06:00 +1100|Etc. , Green , Tech Efficiency is a large stumbling block if you're looking for a way to replace gasoline. It's pretty hard to better such an exceptional fuel, and several alternatives show promise but are nagged by inefficiencies or cost, and usually both. Nanotech to the rescue; it may soon be possible to produce your own hydrogen at home cheaply and easily, and NiMH batteries and fuel cells also stand to become less expensive and offer much better performance. With claims like that, QuantumSphere might well be selling fairy dust, but the Portland, Oregon-based company has developed a nanoparticle coating that may end up being the key to making alternative fuels actually viable. QuantumSphere's catalytic nanoparticle coatings have 1,000 times the surface area of traditional materials, which means that more catalytic action can be housed in the same space. It's the the highly reactive nature of the coatings that allows cheap home electrolysis, also boding well for replacing precious metals like platinum in fuel cells with a coated piece of stainless steel. QuantumSphere's president Kevin Maloney claims that his company's technology makes electrolysers so efficient that they can supply hydrogen on demand while driving. The technology will roll out later this year in a battery that uses a coated cathode for a five-fold increase in energy density, which translates into a 320-percent power gain over alkaline cells. If things go QuantumSphere's way, we won't be paying $100,000 for the Tesla Roadster in a few years, and it will have an even better range than already promised. [Source: Automotive Design Line ] ?

Auto Shows As much as we would like the new vehicle that Kia plans to unveil at the British Motor Show to be the production version of its KOUP concept car, that doesn't seem all that likely. Instead, it appears that Kia has something rather less exciting in store. According to Auto Express , a revised Sportage mini-ute will be unveiled at the upcoming show in July, and this may be the vehicle Kia was referring to in their previous announcement . Nothing major to report as far as the update goes as "subtle improvements" are being made to both the interior and exterior of the vehicle. No changes will be made to the base 2.0-liter four-banger in either gas or diesel form, though the European audience will get an optional 2.7-liter V6 which is already available in the U.S. Considering how popular diesel engines are in the U.K., we're not surprised to hear that the Korean company is working on a revised version for the Sportage with extra power and lower emissions which should be available in short order.

The report claims that Ford is working on a derivative of the all-new F-150 pick-up internally known as "Raptor". The pumped-up version of the popular truck is said to feature a long-travel suspension (developed with Fox Racing), 35-inch tires, and - wait for it - a possibly turbocharged version of the upcoming Boss V8. Essentially a Baja 1000 or Dakar racing truck available to the public, the Raptor would be capable of covering rough terrain at high speeds, and also feature distinctive bodywork wider and lower than a conventional F-150. Word of the Boss V8 finding its way into an F-150 has also led to speculation that Ford is preparing a new Lightning, but the Raptor seems much, much cooler. If given the green light, the Raptor could be a year-and-a-half to two years away. Stay tuned. [Source: Pickuptruck.com ] Gallery: 2009 Ford F-150 ? Read ?|?

Garner's publicist told the AP that the 80-year-old actor is doing well and should be home soon. While Garner's acting career has produced a lengthy and diverse body of work, for a lot of us here at Autoblog, it's hard to think of Jim Garner and not think of Jim Rockford and his gold Firebird Esprit. We're sure there's also no shortage of readers who instantly associate him with his starring role in John Frankenheimer's Grand Prix , hailed by many as the greatest racing movie of all time. Garner was also very active in motorsports in real life, owning American International Racing from 1967-69. He has raced on and off-road, and was inducted to the Off-Road Motorsports Hall of Fame because of his role in elevating the stature of that particular branch of motorsport in the late sixties and early seventies. He's also driven the Indy 500 pace car three times. So, regardless of whether you know him best as Maverick or Jim Rockford, remember also that James Garner's historically a car guy. We wish him well and hope he has a speedy recovery. [Source: AP via CNN , TV Squad ] ? Read ?|?

Due to go on sale later this year, likely after an official unveiling at the LA Auto Show , the 370Z will be packing the same 3.7-liter, VQ37HVR V6 found in the Infiniti G37 , with output estimated at around 335 hp and 278 lb.-ft. of torque (JDM spec). Best Car spoke with the Z34's Chief of Production, Shinjiro Yukawa, and he revealed that a special edition model is being considered that would significantly raise the performance of the new Z by fitting a V8 underhood. The new car will come in about 100 kg (220 pounds) lighter than the outgoing model, and equipped with either a six-speed manual gearbox or a seven-speed sportshift-equipped automatic. Double wishbones will suspend things up front, while a multi-link arrangement will handle duties in the back. The top-spec S and ST versions are expected to roll on upgraded 19-inch wheels, while lower models make due with 18-inch hoops, and Brembo 6-piston front and 4-piston rear brakes will halt forward progress on the high-end models. As expected, the headlamps will feature the same L-shaped design originally debuted on the new Maxima , while the A-pillar and roof treatment are rumored to ape the lines found on the R35 GT-R. Also expect upswept side windows and more bulbous fenders to round out the exterior makeover. [Source: 7Tune ] ? Read ?|?

http://wwwautoblog.com/rss.xml|Fri, 06 Jun 2008 23:59:00 +1000|Trends , Etc. , Lifestyle Top Gear Executive Producer Andy Wilman is aware of the acrimony that surrounds the apparently not-dead-yet U.S. edition of the show, and makes a case on the Top Gear blog for both the Yankee and Australian spinoffs that are marching their way towards prime time audiences soon. Wilman points out that Top Gear 's success is not formulaic like other shows that have been churned in different locations all over the world. May, Clarkson, Hammond and the Stig aren't generic slots on the show that can be easily filled. Plugging people into positions like "here's the guy who used to play in Journey, sitting next to the pop star, who's seated next to the jaded British record executive who's clearly having his time wasted while making enough to purchase a Veyron," won't hold water. Not only can the hosts not be duplicated in a Dick Sargent / Dick York fashion, the shows themselves have to be aware of each other and find ways to fit around what the other is doing. So, the uphill battle facing the localized versions of Top Gear is finding the proper personalities (the Australians already have ) who will genuinely fit together and have chemistry, while also getting those people to do and say things that are compelling without just repeating the schtick of the original in a different location. Wilman acknowledges that those who know about the original Top Gear in North America are fanatics who won't stand for a watered down retooling. Just because there may someday be a homegrown version of TG doesn't mean they'll stop watching the original. One thing that's skirted by Wilman's post is the writing. It's been said many times that the unvarnished opinion that flies on the original won't work on an advertising-dependent network like NBC in the U.S. If the presenters aren't given good material or allowed to riff with leeway, the U.S. Top Gear is dead in the water regardless of the personalities on camera.

http://wwwautoblog.com/rss.xml|Tue, 15 Apr 2008 05:02:00 +1000|SUVs , Chrysler , Jeep , Rumormill According to Bloomberg, the demise of the Jeep Commander is but a year away. Anonymous sources inside Chrysler told the news service that with a 43-percent decline this year, which follows declines every year since its first full year on the market, the Commander is surrendering its command. The SUV's end was claimed to be due to gas prices, since a V8 Commander averages about 17 MPG. However, exorbitant (for America) gas prices haven't killed a number of other vehicles that don't even do that well, so that reasoning makes us wonder. What makes more sense is that in addition to the sales plunge, the Commander was stealing an unexpectedly high number of sales from the Grand Cherokee. In a cozy pool, every little bit of water counts. If it's true, we have to admit we're sorry the Commander is going away. Some people have taken its boxy simplicity for blah-what-boredom, but it was just the kind of Jeep we like: straightforward, capable, roomy (no, we never put seven people in it), and a solid driver. Obviously we don't speak for the masses, but Commander, you will be missed. [Source: Bloomberg ] ? Read ?|?

Our curiosity sufficiently piqued, we clicked the link and watched the vid. What we saw was the new 2009 Cadillac CTS-V being manhandled around Milford. With a running commentary by the driver, the new mid-size supersedan can be seen blasting around Milford at quite alarming speeds. The deep bellow of its 556-hp supercharged 6.2L LS9-derived LSA V8 is amazing. The video is perhaps not as inspiring as the 7:59.32 run around the Nordschleife , but is still quite the spectacle. Actually, it might not even be as exciting as our own video of a recent ride in one at Milford, but it's always fun to see the CTS-V move in a way that belies its bulk and reminds us that American automakers really can build world-class cars.

http://wwwautoblog.com/rss.xml|Sat, 23 Feb 2008 23:17:00 +1100|Nissan , Earnings/Financials Carlos Ghosn, President, Knight , and big cheese at Nissan Motor Company and Renault, says the U.S. auto industry is in recession. Ghosn told the Associated Press, "We are very lucid on the situation of the industry that there is a recession in the United States, at least in the car market." With Nissan division sales in North American down 7.8 percent from this time last year (and the word "recession" literally meaning "the act of receding") few can contest his statement. The Associated Press report adds that deflated U.S. car and light truck sales in 2007 marked the worst sales year in a decade. Brushing off long-term concerns, Ghosn is optimistic the market will improve. Yet, he cites the rising cost of raw materials as yet another concern for automakers. Maybe the best solution to Nissan's current problem is to quintuple production of the GT-R , sell it as both a Nissan and an Infiniti , and bait us all with attractive lease deals ? Yes, that would definitely do the trick. [Source: Just-Auto , subs. req'd] ?

Previously, GM had not indicated that any of these vehicles would be hybridized. Since the Sierra is built on the same GMT900 platform as the already available Tahoe/Yukon two-mode hybrids and the upcoming Escalade and Silverado hybrids, let's tackle that one first. The Silverado and Sierra are essentially the same vehicle with only visual differences, so this one is a no-brainer and it's only a matter of time before GMC announces a Sierra Hybrid. The Lambda hybrids are a different story entirely. According to Brian Corbett, GM's spokesman for Hybrid programs, there are no immediate plans to build a hybrid version of the Lambdas. In fact, during a conversation we had with Bob Lutz at the LA Auto Show, he indicated that the existing front-wheel-drive, two-mode transmission would not fit in the Lambda's engine compartment as it wasn't wide enough. According to Corbett, a second generation version of the two-mode system was under development, but that is at least three to four years away from launch. The mild hybrid system that is currently installed on the Saturn Vue and Aura is designed for smaller vehicles and wouldn't be suitable for the larger Lambdas in its current form. A second-generation version of that system is also under development using a lithium-ion battery and should appear somewhere around 2010-11, which may work in these big wagons. Given the new fuel economy regs, GM is sure to do something with the Lambdas, although dropping in the Cadillac 2.9-liter diesel V-6 might be an even better option that would also help towing capability.

http://wwwautoblog.com/rss.xml|Fri, 28 Mar 2008 05:42:00 +1100|Time Warp , Etc. , Audi , Porsche , Ferrari , UK Growing up as a child in the '80s had its ups and its downs. Sure, every generation looks back at its past-self and wonders-out-loud, "What were you thinking," from time to time. Still, our generation sure did have plenty of cool cars, and many of those were featured on television. A rare day went by when we didn't lust for Magnum P.I. 's Ferrari 308; sitting in the movie theater being mesmerized by Doc's De Lorean (not that it's that great of a car, but it's iconic nonetheless) from Back to the Future ; or salivating over the Ferrari Daytona and Testarossa from Miami Vice ? British television viewers have also had their fair share of hit shows with vehicular co-stars. According to a survey by HPI Limited, Porsche's peerless 911 has earned the top spot as the ultimate '80s car, followed only one percentage point in the rears by the original Audi Quattro -- a car featured on current U.K. television in the show Ashes to Ashes . British TV fans also have fond memories of the Ford Capri SLE 71R driven by Terry McCann in Minder , a long-running comedy-drama in the U.K. With many of our readers residing in our own age bracket, we'd love to get your input on the ultimate '80s car in the comments, and feel free to mention more of your favorite cars made famous on TV.

Your car reminds you to fasten your safety belt with incessant beeps and warning lights fill your dashboard when brake or airbag sensors think something is wrong. But, as the video pasted after the break proves, even standing next to your car can be dangerous under the right circumstances. Dynamometers, or dynos, can be awfully dangerous and are usually surrounded by some sort of guard rail, but not this one in Russia. While it's hard to ignore the guy in the red pants, keep your eyes on the older gentleman at the rear of the room. While our first inclination was to laugh, the reality is that this face-plant could have been much worse. We're glad that the man in the video appears to be alright. Papa!
